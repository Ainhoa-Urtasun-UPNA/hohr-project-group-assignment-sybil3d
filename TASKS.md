***

* Number of businesses in your NAICS code from [Market Research](https://www.naics.com/market-research/): 627
***
* List of your company's primary activities divided into engineering activities and operations activities:

**Engineering activities: In this type of activities we have included the research of the product, prototyping, interior designing, exterior designing and product development.** 
  * In research of the product we have consideredthe creation of the product in a conceptual way, the engineer studying the market, the needs of its potential customers, the posible technical solutions he can offer, the innovations he can make to the existing projects in the market... 
  * In the prototyping we have considered the experimental process in which the engineers implement the design ideas and materializes it in a physical prototype that will have the fundamental characteristics.
  * We have included in our activities both the interior and exterior designing because as our product is a finished home that is ready to move in, they are really involved in the process of creating the product. Our designers will have an engineering background because their implementations must fit exactly in the given structure provided by the engineering team. 
  * The product development will be done by the group of engineers who have done the research of the product, the design and the prototyping. They will look forward to improve the final product based on ideas they can have or even by recommendations that can give in other departments or even by clients. 
     
**Operation activities: Marketing, after-sales service, customer service and quality control**
  * In marketing we have included those activities that tend to enchance the perception of value of the customer. 
  * In after sales service and customer service we have considered the management of complaints of unsatisfied customers, doubts or just helping customers. In these activities we could include the installation service, setting up the manufactured homes, repairements, product adjustments. It is also related to the 20-year warranty that we will offer to our customers. So if there is any defect in the product (it won't happen ideally because we have a quality control department that works hard to prevent those situations taking place) the client will contact our service to ask for a reparation. 
  * In quality control we will have a meticolous group of workers that will have the task of perceiving if there is any flaw in our product and in that case remove that individual product and communicate with the engineering and operations department.

***
* List of your company's support activities:
  * **Transportation and distribution** (logistics)
  * **Waste management**
  * **Human resource management**: recruitments, selection process, hiring and firing, training and development activities, employees support programs, motivation activities, retention of employees and managers
  * **Technology development**: development of programs to get new and useful technology that could be applied in the production process. This could include process automation, product design, new machinery development, environmental programs, telecommunication technology, accounting automation software and customer servicing procedures. The objective is to improve the product and the production process taking into account the efficiency.
  * **Management activities** such as business planning’s, target objectives, business organization, business controls, finance, accounting, legal services, government affairs and quality management, health and safety programs.
  * **Statistical and market analysis** in order know better the market, analyze possibilities, new opportunities.

### Operators

* ONET-SOC code and title:Operating engineers and other construction equipment operators. **CODE:47-2073.00**
*  We have considered this specific role as an operator although the name can make us think that we are looking at an engineer. At first we thought about clasifying it as an engineer, but once we have analyzed the tasks, education and skills demanded for this position we have realized that this role is the one of an operator. In fact, this is the exact operator that we needed because our machinery is high-tech as we have implemented the 3D Industry in a complex sector. So a normal operator wouldn't be as prepared as we need to use and control this specific machinery and one with a higher education will be more useful and efficient. In fact, our operator doesn't need to have a degree but we would need some diplomas in both operation of 3D printers and safety regulation. 
 * 5 most important tasks they carry out (provide the importance score, in Details):
   * They learn and follow safety regulations, The importance score is 97
   * They take actions to avoid potential hazards or obstructions, such as utility lines, other equipment, other workers, or falling objects. The importance score is 92
   * They start engines, move throttles,switches,or levers, or depress pedals to operate machines,such as bulldozers, trench excavators, road graders, or backhoes. The importance score is 90.
   * Coordinate machine actions with other activities, positioning or moving loads in response to hand or audio signals from crew members. The importance score is 88.
   * Align machines, cutterheads,or depth gauge makers with reference stakes and guidelines or ground or position equipment, following hand signals of other workers. The importance score is 87.

* Is this job routine? Your judgment (0-10):8 The operator has a routine job having to operate the machines that print the models and do some routine and simple assemblies in certain pieces that have to be joined. Although the job is very mechanic, the operator is supposed to do certain tasks that are not that routine as controlling the condition of some parts.
* Is this job cognitive? Your judgment (0-10): 3. The job is not highly cognitive as it is not necessary to do really difficult calculous and the knowledge it is needed to be applied is the basic about the utilization and operation of 3D printing machines. 

* 5 most important skills they require to possess (provide the importance score, in Details):
  * Operation and Control — Controlling operations of equipment or systems.See more occupations related to this skill. Score: 78  	
  * Equipment Maintenance — Performing routine maintenance on equipment and determining when and what kind of maintenance is needed.See more occupations related to this skill.  	Score: 56

## Task 3
* Objective: forecast your firm's number of available workers using Python (click the black button at the top of the README.md file)
***
You plan to start hiring workers next year. During this very first year, you are its only workers, all managers. Yearly staff movements were, on average, as follows: Out of 15 managers, 5 stayed in the same occupation, 5 moved to operators, and 5 left the firm; Out of 20 engineers, 10 stayed in the same occupation, 2 moved to managers, 5 moved to operators, and 3 left the firm; Out of 50 operators, 45 stayed in the same occupation and 5 left the firm. Using this information, predict how many managers, engineers, and operators you will have company will have in one year from now.

* D = ([[15,0,0],[0,20,0],[0,0,50]])
* M = ([[5,2,0],[0,10,0],[5,5,45]])
* b = ([[4],[0],[0]])

Theorically, taking into account the data of other companies, at the beggining of the year there were 15 managers, 20 engineers and 50 operators. This correspond to matrix D. Then,  considering the jobs movements explained in the paragraph above, we get the matrix M. Finally, today we have 4 managers in the company, no operators and engineers (matrix B) (calculations can be checked in Laura brand). After solving the operation we get that the expected number of available workers at the end of 2021 are the following: 1,33 managers, 0 engineers and 1,33 operators. That means 1 manager, 0 engineers and 1 operator.

## Task 4
* Objective: forecast your firm's need for workers and anticipate mismatches using Python (click the black button at the top of the README.md file)
***
Last three years data on unemployment for managers was 15%, 17% and 14% for managers; 6%, 6%, 5% for engineers; and 23%, 27%, and 25% for operators. Last three years, the need for workers on average and per firm was 4, 6, 5 for managers; 13, 12, 13 for engineers; and 7, 7, 9 for operators. Using this information, predict how many workers your company will need in one year from now for each of its 3 occupations if unemployment is predicted to be 10% for managers, 4% for engineers, and 20% for operators. 

* X = ([[15,1,0,0],[17,1,0,0],[14,1,0,0],[6,0,1,0],[6,0,1,0],[5,0,1,0],[23,0,0,1],[27,0,0,1],[25,0,0,1]])
* Y = ([[4],[6],[5],[13],[12],[13],[7],[7],[9]])

From the unmeplyment data for each tree types of workers and taking into account the need for workers on average and per firm, if unemployment is predicted to be 10% for managers, 4% for engineers, and 20% for operators , the company is likely to need 4 managers, 12 engineers and 7 operators in one year from now. These predictions are the result of the calculations obtained from the matrix operations. The last matrix obtained was [4'3333,12'458,7'0417], so after the aproximations the predictions obtained are the metioned previously.

Last but not least, for each occupation, compare your predictions to anticipate mismatches.

The expected number of available workers at the end of 2021 was 1 manager, 0 engineers and 1 operator and the company is likely to need 4 managers, 12 engineers and 7 operators in one year from now. So the mismatch  is 3 managers, 12 engineers and 6 operators. The company will have to think about hiring new workers in order to grow and improve its situation.
